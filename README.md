# Computer Vision Algorithms

In this repository, I have implemented some computer vision algorithms from scratch which are used for some specific task.

## Edge Detection

- This algorithm is used for the detecting the edges in the images.
- It contains different algorithms:

1. Simple Sobel Filter: This algorithm can detect the horizontal and vertical edges in image.

2. Harris Response Detection: This algortihm detect the edge based on the harris response.

## Harris Corner Detection

- This algorithm is used for the detecting the corners in the images.

## Image Segmentation

- This contains two different algorithms:

1. Image Binarization: This algorithm segment the image into the black and white image based on the frequency of each color.

2. Spectral Clustering: This algorithm segment the image into the pre-defined cluster numbers.
